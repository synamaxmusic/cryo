The Amiga port of Extase has interactive music by Stephane Picq.

Unless you're a very skilled player, it is impossible to hear the last track
of the OST because the final level "Droid Ecstasis" doesn't show up during the 
attract mode demo.

Using WinUAE's debugger we can force the music driver to load a different track
while loading a level.

We'll need to set up a breakpoint before the level loads.  Type in:

f 12c8

Then either start a game or wait for the demo to start.
The debugger will pop up during the loading screen, stopping at address $12c8

Register D0 contains our music track ID.  Here's a list of all the music tracks
and their assigned ID:

0 = Dream Zone
1 = Vision Control
2 = Madness
3 = Cry of Love
4 = Mystic Crisis
5 = Ideas Stimulus
6 = Fear
7 = Droid Ecstasis

To change the ID to play Ideas Stimulus for example, type in:

r d0 5


<<< Various notes for MOD music tracker files >>>

$21E2C = Sample Table (start of file)
$21FE8 = Sequence Data

Tracks 1 and 2 appear to be regular music
Tracks 3 and 4 appear to be interactive events (there is one-known exception..."Ideas Stimulus" has Shaku flute phrase on track 4)

"Bump" event on track 3 appears at offset 0288, then repeats every $400 bytes ($22270, $22670, $22A70, $22E70, $23270)

use "Ma C" to mask only audio channels 3 and 4
use "Ma 3" to mask only audio channels 1 and 2

Ma 8 = Track 4 only
Ma 4 = Track 3 only
Ma 2 = Track 2 only
Ma 1 = Track 1 only

Dream Zone:

Valid instrument numbers: 3,5,6,7,8,9,B,C,D

3 = PAD
5 = Moan
6 = bass guitar
7 = rain stick perc
8 = xylo
9 = SARARR
B = Heartbeat
C = Windchimes 
D = FM Tubular Bell
F = SILENCE (USED FOR STOPPING NOTES)

Sample data for Dream Zone pad starts at $000233E8
Sample table starts at around $00021E4C ($000233E8 is referenced here)
Sample table FOR ALL SONGS ACTUALLY starts at $21E2C!


00 02 33 E8 12 87 00 40 00 02 46 42 09 5A FF FF

Sample table seems to be similar to MOD format:

Sample start = 000233E8
Sample Length! = 1287
Volume = 0040
Loop start = 00024642
Loop length = 095A

One-shot samples have 7F80 for loop start and 0002 for loop length.


Sequence data:

After the Sample table, we have a table at $21F1C that appears to be the sequence table.

00000008 = Number of patterns
0000 = Pattern 1 offset
0400 = Pattern 2 offset
0800 = Pattern 3 offset
0800 = Pattern 3 offset again
0C00 = Pattern 4 offset 
0C00 = Pattern 4 offset again
1000 = Pattern 5 offset 
1000 = Pattern 5 offset again
FFFF = SONG PLAYBACK FLAG (written to $21F30 at instruction 630C...FF also written to $63A3)


Sequence data for all songs starts at $21FE8

01AC 8340

First two bytes = Pitch (01AC)
3rd byte (1st nibble) = Instrument (8)
3rd byte (2nd nibble) = Effect (3)
4th byte = Effect parameter (40)


Every $100 bytes is 4 beats ($40 per beat)


Sequence data for first pad note at $000223E8?
Sequence data for 2nd pad note at $000227E8?
Sequence data for third note at $000229E8?

Pad note loops back to 227E8 to repeat higher note

When xylo arp starts playing, we start playing at $00022BE8, then next measure starts at $00022DE8
